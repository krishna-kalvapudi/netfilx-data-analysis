****Project Overview:****

This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the "Netflix Movies and TV Shows" dataset, publicly available on Kaggle. The goal of this analysis is to uncover key trends and patterns within Netflix's content library, providing insights into its growth, content distribution, and popular genres and creators.

This project demonstrates proficiency in:

Data Cleaning & Pre-processing: Handling missing values and ensuring data integrity.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Using statistical methods and visualization to discover insights.

Data Visualization: Creating informative and compelling charts to present findings.

Analytical Thinking: Formulating questions and using data to find answers.

**Dataset**

-- The dataset used is netflix_titles.csv, which contains a list of all movies and TV shows available on Netflix, including details like title, director, cast, genre, release year, and ratings.

**Tools Used**
-- Python: The core language for the analysis.

-- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

-- Matplotlib: For creating static, publication-quality visualizations.

-- Seaborn: For creating aesthetically pleasing statistical graphics.

Jupyter Notebook: The environment for conducting the analysis and documenting the process.

**Key Questions and Insights**

-- This analysis focuses on answering the following questions:

-- What is the distribution of movies versus TV shows on Netflix?

-- How has the volume of content added to Netflix changed over the years?

-- What are the most popular genres for both movies and TV shows?

-- Who are the most prolific directors and actors in the Netflix content library?

-- What are the most common ratings and how are they distributed?

The Jupyter Notebook Netflix.ipynb contains the full analysis, code, and visualizations that provide answers to these questions.
